# Micro Air Conditioner Circuit
In this project, we present a Micro-Air Conditioner concept design as an educational tool to demonstrate our practical understanding of Analog Design principles we learned in Analog Electronics class. Through essential subsystems like Control Unit, Set Unit, Sensing Unit and Display Unit, we explore the tangible integration of Analog Design concepts. The Control Unit dynamically manages the heating and cooling operation based on ambient and desired temperatures. The Set Unit receives the desired temperature from user and feeds the Display Unit and Control Unit with appropriate voltage value based on the desired temperature. The Sensing Unit utilizes an analog temperature sensor to feed the Display and Control Units the ambient temperature as the voltage value based on the ambient temperature. Featuring an RGB LED, the Display Unit visually represents the ambient or desired temperature. This project underscores our commitment to design specifications, theoretical background, and mathematical analyses. This comprehensive report covers the entire process, from conceptualization to simulation results and experimental findings.  
## Units  
### Sensing Unit
![SensingUnit_Circuit](https://github.com/emirhan-yasar/micro-air-conditioner-circuit/assets/84876671/b3da7b7a-b053-4430-9baa-fbcd2a3e6145)  
The sensing unit circuit consists of a voltage divider and a voltage buffer. The voltage divider circuit allows us to control the output voltage by the resistance value of the NTC thermistor.  
### Set Unit
